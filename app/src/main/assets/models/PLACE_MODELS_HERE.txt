Place your ONNX model files in this directory:

1. melspectrogram.onnx - Converts raw audio to mel spectrograms
2. embedding_model.onnx - Converts mel spectrograms to speech embeddings 
3. [wake_word_name].onnx - Wake word detection models (e.g., hey_computer.onnx, ok_assistant.onnx)

These files are required for the wake-up word detection to function properly.

For more information, please refer to the README.md in the project root.
